## Start 
- should start with function keyword / arrow functions
- component name should start with capital letter
- you should have component body (jsx) + component logic
- export that component to use outside 

## jsx in react
- react use createelement to create particular element
- createelement takes 3 args : element,properties and child
- element ->  can be any html tag ie div , h1,p
- properties -> classname ,id,click 
- children /body
- for eg.  return React.createElement('div','','This component')

## State management and Hook
- useState -> hook that allow us to add react state in function component
- useReducer

## async js
- async makes a function to return promise 
- await makes a function stop and wait for promise before it continue
- promise is js object that generates value after async function success or 
 an error if it doesnot success due to time out,network error
